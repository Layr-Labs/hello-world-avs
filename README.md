# Hello World AVS

Welcome to the Hello World AVS.

This project shows you the simplest functionality you can expect from an AVS.

It will give you a concrete understanding of the basic components.

There are 5 steps to this AVS:
- AVS consumer requests a "Hello World" message to be generated and signed
- AVS takes on the request by emitting an event for operators to pick up the request
- any operator who is staked to serve this AVS takes this request, generates this message and signs it
- the operator submits this message with their signature back to the AVS
- *if the operator is in fact registered to the AVS and has the minimum needed stake, the submission is accepted*

That's it. This simple flow highlights some of the core mechanics of how AVSs work.

Where additional sophistication with AVSs come into the picture:
- the nature of the request is more sophisicated than generating a constant string
- the operators might need to coordinate with each other
- the type of signature is different based on the constraints of the service
- the type and amount of security used to secure the AVS
- and so on...

## Quick Start

### Dependencies 

1. [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm)
2. [Foundry](https://getfoundry.sh/)
3. [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started/)

### Steps

1. Make sure Docker is running
2. Run `npm install`
3. Run `make start-chain-with-contracts-deployed`

    2.1 This will build the contracts, start an Anvil chain, deploy the contracts to it, and leaves the chain running in the current terminal
4. Open new terminal tab and run `make start-operator`

    3.1 This will compile the AVS software and start monitering new tasks
5. Open new terminal tab and run `make spam-tasks` (Optional) 

    4.1 This will spam the AVS with random names every 15 seconds

## Extensions

- Operator needs a minimum stake amount to make submissions
- Add another strategy to the AVS
- Operator must respond within a certain number of blocks
