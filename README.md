# Hello World AVS

Welcome to the Hello World AVS. This project shows you the simplest functionality you can expect from an AVS. It will give you a concrete understanding of the basic components.

## AVS User Flow

1) AVS consumer requests a "Hello World" message to be generated and signed.
2) HelloWorld contract receives the request and emits a NewTaskCreated event for the request.
3) All Operators who are registered to the AVS and has staked, delegated assets takes this request. Operator generates the requested message, hashes it, and signs the hash with their private key.
4) Each Operator submits their signed hash back to the HelloWorld AVS contract.
5) If the Operator is registered to the AVS and has the minimum needed stake, the submission is accepted.

That's it. This simple flow highlights some of the core mechanics of how AVSs work.

# Local Devnet Deployment

The following instructions explain how to manually deploy the AVS from scratch including EigenLayer and AVS specific contracts using Foundry (forge) to a local anvil chain, and start Typescript Operator application and tasks.

Install dependencies:

- [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/download)
- [ts-node](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ts-node)
- [tcs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tcs#installation)
- [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm)
- [Foundry](https://getfoundry.sh/)
- [ethers](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ethers)

### Start Anvil Chain

In terminal window #1, execute the following commands:

```sh

# Install npm packages
npm install

# Start local anvil chain
npm run start:anvil
```

### Deploy Contracts and Start Operator

Open a separate terminal window #2, execute the following commands

```sh
# Setup .env file
cp .env.example contracts/.env
cp .env.example .env

# Updates dependencies if necessary and builds the contracts 
npm run build

# Deploy the EigenLayer contracts
npm run deploy:core

# Deploy the Hello World AVS contracts
npm run deploy:hello-world

# (Optional) Update ABIs if your smart contract code has changed.
npm run extract:abis

# Start the Operator application
npm run start:operator

```

### Create Hello-World-AVS Tasks

Open a separate terminal window #3, execute the following commands

```sh
# Start the createNewTasks application 
npm run start:traffic
```

### Disclaimers

- This repo is meant currently intended for _local anvil development testing_. Holesky deployment support will be added shortly.
- Users who wish to build an AVS for Production purposes will want to migrate from the `ECDSAServiceManagerBase` implementation in `HelloWorldServiceManager.sol` to a BLS style architecture using [RegistryCoordinator](https://github.com/Layr-Labs/eigenlayer-middleware/blob/dev/docs/RegistryCoordinator.md).

# Appendix (Future Capabilities In Progress)

## Deployment on Tenderly Virtual Testnet

Follow the [Tenderly Virtual Testnet Setup Instructions](https://docs.tenderly.co/virtual-testnets/quickstart) to create a new virtual testnet.

Run the following commands:

```sh

# todo: add instructions to create a wallet for testnet account and set private key in .env holesky vars

# Set env vars
cd contracts
source ../.env

# Fund account using the tenderly rpc
curl $TENDERLY_RPC_ADMIN \
-X POST \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "method": "tenderly_setBalance",
    "params": [
      [
        "'"${PUBLIC_KEY}"'"
        ],
      "0xDE0B6B3A7640000"
      ],
    "id": "1234"
}'

# Deploy AVS contracts to Tenderly Holesky using Foundry
forge script script/HelloWorldDeployerHolesky.s.sol:HelloWorldDeployerHolesky \
    --rpc-url $TENDERLY_RPC_ADMIN --private-key $TENDERLY_PRIVATE_KEY --broadcast -vvv debug
```

## Adding a New Strategy

## Potential Enhancements to the AVS (for learning purposes)

The architecture can be further enhanced via:

- the nature of the request is more sophisticated than generating a constant string
- the operators might need to coordinate with each other
- the type of signature is different based on the constraints of the service
- the type and amount of security used to secure the AVS

## Rust Operator instructions

### Automated deployment (uses existing state file)

1. Run `make start-chain-with-contracts-deployed`
    - This will build the contracts, start an Anvil chain, deploy the contracts to it, and leaves the chain running in the current terminal

2. Run `make start-rust-operator`

3. Run `make spam-rust-tasks`

Tests are supported in anvil only . Make sure to run the 1st command before running the  tests:

```
cargo test --workspace
```

## Existing Holesky Testnet Deployment

| Contract Name               | Holesky Address                                   |
| -------------               | -------------                                     |
| Hello World Service Manager | [0x3361953F4a9628672dCBcDb29e91735fb1985390](https://holesky.etherscan.io/address/0x3361953F4a9628672dCBcDb29e91735fb1985390)    |

Please see [Current Testnet Deployment](https://github.com/Layr-Labs/eigenlayer-contracts?tab=readme-ov-file#current-testnet-deployment) for additional deployed addresses.

You don't need to run a deployment script for holesky testnet, the contracts are already deployed.

1. Use the HOLESKY_ namespace env parameters in the code , instead of normal parameters.

2. Run `make start-rust-operator`

3. Run `make spam-rust-tasks`
